The Island of the Dolls is a true ghost story about a scary place in Mexico that is said to be
haunted by the ghost of a young girl. It is also known as Isla de las Munecas.

The Island of the Dolls is located just south of Mexico City, between the canals of
Xochimico. It is famous as being one of the scariest places in the world.

The island is covered with the severed heads and dismembered bodies of creepy old dolls.
They hang from the branches of trees, their glass eyes staring at anyone who passes by. At
night, things become even more disturbing. Some people claim the dolls move their heads
and arms and open their eyes. Others say that they have heard the dolls whispering to each
other in the darkness.

They say that, years ago, a man named Don Julian Santana lived alone on the island. One
day, he found the dead body of a young girl floating face-down in the canal. She had
drowned.

He believed that her ghost haunted the island. The man collected dolls and hung them from
the trees to appease the dead girlâ€™s restless spirit. He thought this would make the little girl
happy and keep evil spirits at bay. As time went by, he came to believe that the dolls were
possessed by the spirits of the dead.


The story took an even more sinister turn in 2001 when Don Julian was found dead under
mysterious circumstances. He drowned in the canal at exactly the same spot where he found
the little girl years before. Some people say that the old man was murdered by his dolls.


Today, the Island of the Dolls is a tourist destination. People come from all over the world to
see the creepy and bizarre decorations.

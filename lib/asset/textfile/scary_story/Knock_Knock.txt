Knock Knock is a scary story about a young boy and his sister who are left home alone when
their parents go out for the night. It is based on an urban legend.

As their mother was leaving, she they told her children not to open the door under any
circumstances.

“If anyone knocks, don’t answer it,” she told them.

But the boy and his sister didn’t pay attention to their mother’s warning. They thought she
was being too careful. They figured they could take care of themselves in any situation.

About an hour after the parents left, the kids heard a “knock, knock, knock” on the front
door. They decided to ignore it, but again, they heard “knock, knock, knock”. It happened again and again and it grew louder each time.

Eventually, the girl couldn’t stand it anymore and she told her brother she was going to
answer the door. When the boy reminded her of their mother’s warning, the girl just wouldn’t
listen.

Again, they heard the “knock, knock, knock” on the door. Finally the sister went downstairs.
Her brother lay on the sofa watcing TV. He heard his sister’s footsteps walking down the
stairs. He heard her asking loudly “Who is it?”. He heard her open the lock on the front door.

Then he heard only silence. He lay there for a while, listening for any noise, but heard
nothing. Eventually, he started getting scared. His sister still hadn’t returned. He was afraid to
call out to his sister, so he sneaked out the back door and made his way to their neighbor’s
house.

When he went into their house, his neighbor was watching the local news channel on TV.
The news anchor on TV was talking about a murder. Then they showed a reporter live at the
scene of the murder.

The neighbor said to the boy, “Hey that looks like your house”.

The boy was shaking with fear. “That is my house”, he said. “And that’s my front door”.

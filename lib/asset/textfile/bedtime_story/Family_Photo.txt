The Family Photo is a tale of horror about a young girl who dies and her distraught mother
who wonders what has become of her daughter.

There was a single mother who had three daughters. The youngest daughter was diagnosed
with an inoperable brain tumor. The doctors broke the bad news to her mother. They told the
poor woman that her daughter had only three months to live.

The family were devastated by the horrible news. The mother decided to have a family photo
taken while her youngest daughter was still alive. That way, they would always have
something to remember her by.

They hired a professional photographer to come and take the photo. The family posed with
the youngest daughter sitting in the middle of the picture and her mother and older sisters
arranged around her. Afterwards, they had it framed and hung it over the fireplace in the
living room.

Three months later, the youngest daughter died in hospital. Her mother and her two sisters
were at her bedside when she passed away. The funeral took place two days later.

After the funeral, the mother was sitting in the living room when she happened to glance up
at the family photo over the fireplace. She was horrified to discover that her daughter’s face
in the photo was shifting and changing. It looked distended and deformed. Almost demonic.

They brought the family photo to the professional photographer and complained. He said he
had no explanation for why the photo would suddenly change, making the dead child appear
so grotesque.

The mother was at her wit’s end. She took the family photo to a psychic and begged the
psychic to tell her what was wrong. The psychic took one look at the family photo and
recoiled in horror.

“I’m sorry to have to tell you this”, said the psychic. “Unfortunately, your daughter fell into
hell.”
